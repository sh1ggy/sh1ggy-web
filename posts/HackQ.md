The Hack Quarantine was focussed on creating something that would help combat issues the quarantine had caused the world. We decided to make a COVID Toolkit including a country statistics, hand-washing timer and FAQ section.   

This second hackathon acted as more of a reaffirmation of the things that I learnt in the first hackathon as well as something to do during the quarantine period. The end product was more refined than the first hackathon as the format was much simpler since everyone in my team of three had a role to play. 

## Skills Learnt	
 - **Android Studio**: The FAQ section and timer (with I gained a lot of confidence learning Android Studio as the environment was much more relaxed than in the previous hackathon. My main tasks handled layout and a timer feature. 
 - **GitHub**: The GitHub collaboration was much more involved with us making proper commits, managing branches and resolving merge conflicts which did challenge our knowledge. 

## Conclusion
This experience led me to pursue mobile app development more, picking it as my minor in university. There wasn't much challenge in my role in this hackathon and so I feel as though it was more of a springboard than something to challenge me like the previous hackathon did.
