This website includes a blog overviewing my personal programming journey as well as as a fun way to play around with website development and show off a bit of my personality. The blog posts themselves are written in Markdown, using [MarkedJS](https://marked.js.org/) to parse and compile it. 

The website itself is still currently a work in progress.
